<h2>Who is KSB Design?</h2>
<p>Hi there! My name's Kendall and this is my design company, KSB Design. I am currently pursuing my graphic design degree at California State University East Bay. I've been involved in the arts since I was little and have been pushing to further my skills more and more every day. After my bachelor's degree, I will be getting my master's. I've created many different pieces based on different needs and different requirements. Take a look at my portfolio to see some of my work. Please feel free to contact KSB Design for more information.
